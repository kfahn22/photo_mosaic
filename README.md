# Photo Mosaic

I have used Daniel Shiffmans's code from his [Photo Mosaic with White House Coding Challenge](https://thecodingtrain.com/challenges/49-photo-mosaic-with-white-house-social-media-images)
to create a photo mosaic tribute to my wonderful dog Bella.

## Dogs

There are lots of places to find a dataset of images.  One of the easiest is Kaggle, which is where I downloaded the [Standford Dogs dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/stanford-dogs-dataset).  This dataset consists of over 20,000 images of 120 dog breeds and is really designed to be used for image classification.  Once I downloaded the dataset, I moved a portion (5000) of the images into one folder named dogs so I could load them into the Processing sketch.  You can find the code that I used on the Coding Train website.
